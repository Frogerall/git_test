# Project Title

#### Git Test

## Description

My first Git repositoryâ€”nothing fancy, just a record of my initial attempts at using Git.
Expect a mix of commits and exploration as I navigate through version control for the first time.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Git installed on your system.

Ensure Git is installed on your machine before proceeding.

### Installing

1. Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.
3. No additional modifications are needed; you're ready to use Git!

### Executing program

To run Git, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to use Git.
3. Initialize a new Git repository or clone an existing one:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
4. Start making commits to track changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```
5. Push changes to a remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

Now you're set to use Git for version control... this is a very simple guide when i first start using Git.

## Help

If you encounter common problems or issues while using Git, here are three tips to help you:

- **Issue**: Forgetting to configure your identity.

  ```bash
  git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

  ```

- **Issue**: Making changes without creating a branch.
  ```bash
  git branch feature_branch    # Create a new branch
  git checkout feature_branch  # Switch to the new branch
  ```

Remember to check the official Git documentation for more detailed assistance.
